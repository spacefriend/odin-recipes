        <p>This is a simple recipe for oatmeal. All ingredients have a long shelf life even once opened, so I like to keep them on hand for those mornings I realize I ran out of eggs. It can easily be customized with different toppings, so you can never get tired of it!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 cups of water</li>
            <li>2/3 cups oats</li>
            <li>1 small handful of raisins</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon apple pie spice mix</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water, vanilla and raisins to a small saucepan and begin heating on medium heat</li>
            <li>Once the water begins to simmer, add the oats and stir</li>
            <li>After a minute when the oats have absorbed most of the water, reduce the heat and stir in the spice mix and maple syrup</li>
            <li>Once the oatmeal has reached the desired consistency, it is ready to serve </li>
            <li>(Optional) You can add some extra maple syrup if you like it sweeter, and if it isn't filling enough you can dip a slice of buttered toast in it</li>

        </ol>
